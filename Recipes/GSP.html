  <h4>Directions</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, 
      lighting burners on just one side or pushing lit coals to one side. Preheat to medium-high heat (375 to 400 degrees F (180 to 200 degrees C)). 
      Lightly oil grill grates over lit side.</li>
    <li>Grill poblanos and corn, covered, turning occasionally, until poblano
      skins and corn are charred, about 10 minutes. Keep grill lit.</li>
    <li>Transfer poblanos to a large bowl, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. 
      Meanwhile, let corn stand until cool enough to handle; cut kernels from cobs.</li>
    <li>Remove and discard poblano skins, keeping stems intact. 
      Make a lengthwise slit down one side of each poblano, 
      starting at stem and being careful not to cut through to other side.
      Remove and discard seeds and membranes.</li>
    <li>Stir together beans, corn kernels, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a large bowl.
       Spoon about 1/2 cup bean mixture into each pepper, enclosing pepper around the filling.
    </li>
    <li>For the cheese sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; whisk in flour. Cook, stirring until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in milk; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in cheese until melted. Remove from heat and keep warm, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed poblanos, covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed poblanos, covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
